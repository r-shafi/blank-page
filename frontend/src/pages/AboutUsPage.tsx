                Our History
              </h2>
              <p>
                Founded in early 2020, Blank Page emerged from a collective
                desire to restore depth and nuance to contemporary discourse. As
                traditional print media continued to decline and social media
                algorithms pushed increasingly polarized content, our founders—a
                diverse group of journalists, academics, and technology
                experts—saw an opportunity to create something different.
              </p>

              <p className="my-4">
                What began as a small digital publication with a handful of
                contributors has grown into a thriving platform featuring voices
                from across the political spectrum, united by a commitment to
                factual accuracy, intellectual honesty, and thoughtful analysis.

              <p>
                At Blank Page, we believe that democratic society thrives on
                informed citizens engaged in good-faith dialogue. Our mission is
                to provide readers with reporting and analysis that:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
                <li>
                  Prioritizes accuracy and context over speed and sensationalism

                <li>

                  Contributes positively to public discourse on pressing issues

              </ul>

              <p>
                We strive not just to inform, but to foster deeper understanding
                of complex issues, believing that reasonable people can disagree
                on solutions while agreeing on facts.

                Our Principles
              </h2>
              <p>
                Blank Page operates according to these core journalistic
                principles:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Independence:</strong> We maintain editorial
                  independence from financial and political interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Accuracy:</strong> We verify information before
                  publishing and correct errors promptly and transparently.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fairness:</strong> We present competing perspectives
                  on controversial issues and give subjects of criticism the
                  opportunity to respond.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Transparency:</strong> We disclose our methods,
                  sources (when possible), and potential conflicts of interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Humanity:</strong> We recognize the human impact of
                  news events and respect the dignity of all people in our
                  coverage.
